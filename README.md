# ledstriptestrig
A rig for quickly testing LED strips using FastLED.

## Overview
Since I order a lot of LED strips, I wanted to set up a more permanent rig to test them quickly when I receive them. This allows me to select the chipset and number of LEDs, and then it proceeds to run some LED animations so I can make sure the strip is okay.

## Status
I've built a working prototype! Next I need to solder things together and make a case.

A note - so far I have not used any 2-wire type LED strips, but this setup could easily change to accommodate that.
